# AirBNB-NewUser-bookings-ML-Project
https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-new-user/overview

New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. Predicting the region of booking will help provide better content to the users with regard to their choice of destination, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand, thus benefitting both the customers and Airbnb.

The goal of this project is to predict 3 most likely final destinations of users on Airbnb, a vacation rental company based on various parameters for each individual user and the date and time of booking to the destination country and parameters for each country too.
